menuconfig NETDEVICES
	default y if UML
	depends on NET
	bool "Network device support"
	---help---
	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
	  any other computer at all.

	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
	  you want to use under Linux. If you are going to run SLIP or PPP over
	  telephone line or null modem cable you need say Y here. Connecting
	  two machines with parallel ports using PLIP needs this, as well as
	  AX.25/KISS for sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links.

	  See also "The Linux Network Administrator's Guide" by Olaf Kirch and
	  Terry Dawson. Available at <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config NET_CORE
	default y
	bool "Network core driver support"
	---help---
	  You can say N here if you do not intend to use any of the
	  networking core drivers (i.e. VLAN, bridging, bonding, etc.)

if NET_CORE

config BONDING
	tristate "Bonding driver support"
	depends on INET
	depends on IPV6 || IPV6=n
	---help---
	  Say 'Y' or 'M' if you wish to be able to 'bond' multiple Ethernet
	  Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
	  'Trunking' by Sun, 802.3ad by the IEEE, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

	  The driver supports multiple bonding modes to allow for both high
	  performance and high availability operation.

	  Refer to <file:Documentation/networking/bonding.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called bonding.

config DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy net driver support"
	---help---
	  This is essentially a bit-bucket device (i.e. traffic you send to
	  this device is consigned into oblivion) with a configurable IP
	  address. It is most commonly used in order to make your currently
	  inactive SLIP address seem like a real address for local programs.
	  If you use SLIP or PPP, you might want to say Y here. Since this
	  thing often comes in handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your
	  kernel either. What a deal. Read about it in the Network
	  Administrator's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called dummy.  If you want to use more than one dummy
	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
	  Instead of 'dummy', the devices will then be called 'dummy0',
	  'dummy1' etc.

config EQUALIZER
	tristate "EQL (serial line load balancing) support"

	  Please read <file:Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called tun.

	  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

config VETH
	tristate "Virtual ethernet pair device"
	---help---
	  This device is a local ethernet tunnel. Devices are created in pairs.
	  When one end receives the packet it appears on its pair and vice
	  versa.

config VIRTIO_NET
	tristate "Virtio network driver (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && VIRTIO
	---help---
	  This is the virtual network driver for virtio.  It can be used with
	  lguest or QEMU based VMMs (like KVM or Xen).  Say Y or M.

config NET_SB1000
	tristate "General Instruments Surfboard 1000"
	depends on PNP
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the General Instrument (also known as
	  NextLevel) SURFboard 1000 internal
	  cable modem. This is an ISA card which is used by a number of cable
	  TV companies to provide cable modem access. It's a one-way
	  downstream-only cable modem, meaning that your upstream net link is
	  provided by your regular phone modem.

	  At present this driver only compiles as a module, so say M here if
	  you have this card. The module will be called sb1000. Then read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/README.sb1000> for information on how
	  to use this module, as it needs special ppp scripts for establishing
	  a connection. Further documentation and the necessary scripts can be
	  found at:

	  <http://www.jacksonville.net/~fventuri/>
	  <http://home.adelphia.net/~siglercm/sb1000.html>
	  <http://linuxpower.cx/~cable/>

	  If you don't have this card, of course say N.

	select XEN_XENBUS_FRONTEND
	default y
	help
	  This driver provides support for Xen paravirtual network
	  devices exported by a Xen network driver domain (often
	  domain 0).

	  The corresponding Linux backend driver is enabled by the
	  CONFIG_XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND option.

	  If you are compiling a kernel for use as Xen guest, you
	  should say Y here. To compile this driver as a module, chose
	  M here: the module will be called xen-netfront.

config XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "Xen backend network device"
	depends on XEN_BACKEND
	help
	  This driver allows the kernel to act as a Xen network driver
	  domain which exports paravirtual network devices to other
	  Xen domains. These devices can be accessed by any operating
	  system that implements a compatible front end.

	  The corresponding Linux frontend driver is enabled by the
	  CONFIG_XEN_NETDEV_FRONTEND configuration option.

	  The backend driver presents a standard network device
	  endpoint for each paravirtual network device to the driver
	  domain network stack. These can then be bridged or routed
	  etc in order to provide full network connectivity.

	  If you are compiling a kernel to run in a Xen network driver
	  domain (often this is domain 0) you should say Y here. To
	  compile this driver as a module, chose M here: the module
	  will be called xen-netback.

config VMXNET3
	tristate "VMware VMXNET3 ethernet driver"
	depends on PCI && INET
	help
	  This driver supports VMware's vmxnet3 virtual ethernet NIC.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vmxnet3.
